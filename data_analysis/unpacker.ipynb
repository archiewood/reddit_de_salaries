      "Yes, what I mean is that after moving past the entry level, I think most people would be better off working on soft skills and leadership skills. Beyond a certain point, there is diminishing $$ returns on being a technical expert. Most business problems don't require novel technical solutions, you just need to have deep domain understanding for the corner of the business you're in, which will in turn help you identify ways to use data to help your company save or make money. And know how to write and speak effectively.\n",
      "I lurk here as I’ve done a good amount of SQL in my career, and am trying to develop more of a conceptual knowledge of data engineering. I don’t need it per se, but I’m trying to bolster my technical knowledge. I work in the finance industry.\n",
      "My income is below yours (350k-ish), but my income skyrocketed as I moved away from pure technology knowledge (I’ve never been a developer, but I was more of a ‘jack of all trades’ technical BA), and more towards understanding the business side of things. I’ve probably gone a little too overboard in being so focused on domain knowledge, hence the reason I want to bolster my tech knowledge so I can lead more effectively, but it’s absolutely the way to go. I see so many developers and data people who just don’t want to be involved in truly understanding the business they work in, and then they’ll complain about their income growth stalling. Even today, finding a good data person or a dev who truly understands finance, is a real unicorn. Generally speaking, the path to income growth for most people isn’t from silo-ing into pure tech (unless your product is tech, of course)\n",
      "I wish recruiters can see that as I apply for data analyst roles (hoping to become DE after DA). I come from an accounting/finance background (4 YOE) and I get outright rejected to entry-level DA/BA/BI roles. But definitely good to know that there are people out there who actually consider this type of background!\n",

      "What are some business concepts that you’d recommend learning about that you think are in need or valuable?\n",
      "It depends what industry you’re in. I don’t mean just general business concepts, but rather that in whatever domain you’re in, the path to showing value is by being someone who can see the ‘big picture’.\n",
      "Okay perfect thank you for taking the time!\n",
      "This is interesting because unlike most (assuming most) I'm coming from a business standpoint and trying to get into DE by working on some technical skills. I have experience with business in general just from years of doing different side projects/businesses along with my main W2. To me, by default, I think from the businesses standpoint (bigger picture) when it comes to data and what would be important. So anyway, I'm learning some tech skills and trying to become a DE.\n",

      "Beyond that I would say try to do some small sample projects and put them on your Github. From there, interview around at some firms! My company lets candidates choose a programming language of their choice during interviews, and the interview itself was mostly problem solving (and very conversational, not an interrogation), not even much about Data Engineering itself.

I've done this course in the past (to learn some services) and it was a really gentle introduction if that's your thing:\n",
      "It really depends. Some companies do emphasize L33T Code unfortunately, but some don't. A lot of companies (in Canada at least) are moving towards more discussion-based interviews, where they present a problem and you work through it together. It is more about testing your skills/competencies related to programming/problem solving and less so on memorizing algorithms. For this it unfortunately comes down to practice imo, so picking up some books can help get you started with the right mindset. I highly recommend Cracking the Coding Interview (\n",
      "Honestly anything works here. Just Google \"Data Engineering Projects\" and go with it. Spin up a streaming service (for something). Spin up an orchestrated data pipeline using Airflow. Deploy a small application that scrapes data from a public database, massages/transforms it and stores it in a Data Warehouse. It really is not that important what you pick as long as it's relevant to Data Engineering, or Software Engineering in general.\n",

      "The DE industry in Canada is growing all the time. Virtually all companies these days rely on Big Data to some extent, and most are applying Data Science/ML to solve problems too. In order for both to scale, you need Data Engineers to move and clean up the data! This article about Canada's tech scene gives a good overview of the industry nowadays: \n",
      "As far as pay, it really depends. I don't have visibility into company pay structures directly, but this is a great resource for getting some insight into the market in general:\n",
      "With the onset of remote working being a necessity (and likely sticking around for a while after the pandemic is over) too, it also makes salary harder to track. You would need to do your research on the company-level at that \n",
      "I cannot comment on working in the United States as I have never lived nor worked there. I was born, raised, and have lived in Canada my entire life. I am biased in saying Canada has many advantages (free healthcare, lower crime rates in large cities, less gun violence proportionally, a smaller population density, better educational levels), but the United States is an amazing country as well. I always enjoy visiting there, but I do not know if I would want to live there. Their salary, amentities, and weather are all superior to Canada, among other things, but they also have a much more individual mindset and I always find they are a country of winners and losers (some with a lot many with none). Take that as you will. \n",

If you are looking for a school with a good co-op program, then the University of Waterloo and UBC are your two best bets (for East and West coasts respectively). Otherwise I don't know of any schools with as much focus on co-ops as on research. All the best, hope that helps!\n",

      "Sure but it was nowhere close to my salary increase, even though I went from LCOL to VHCOL. On top of that a bunch of expenses went down: my wife and I were able to get rid of one car so our insurance dropped, and because we went from a no-fault state to a tort state, our premium went down from what a one car premium would be in Florida. Food can be as cheap or expensive as you make it, utilities are cheaper because you don’t need to run A/C all the time and if you’re renting most buildings pay for heat. My utility bill could be as low as 30 or 40 dollars outside of summer in Boston.\n",
      "Less tangibly, but arguably more important, there is a lot more opportunity for software engineers in a city like Boston, whereas where I was there was only a handful of employers, most offering below market for the state. A year after doubling my base, my employer was winding down (thanks CFIUS!) so I went to another company and increased my base another 30%.\n",

      "You do know that salaries are pegged to the cost of living in the area, don't you? They're not going to pay Bay level salaries in London - that'd be an absolute disaster for everyone else.\n",
      "Quality of life is also a thing. Life isn't about chasing the highest numbers you can. I could move to the US and admittedly receive a higher net salary after the cost of living is removed, but, well, I'd have to live in the US, and that to me is a dealbreaker.\n",
      "Grow the fuck up.\n",
      "Pardon my ignorance on the matter but I was under the impression that London was one of the most expensive cities on earth to live in. How much does say a 2 bedroom apartment in London cost? I’m not from the UK so I really have no idea what cost of living is like there.\n",
      "It is, but the Bay Area and other big US cities are higher. Cost of living isn’t the only factor of course; salaries are also tied to the market rate for your role, and when comparing cross countries you also have to take things like working hours (normally less in the U.K.), paid holidays (An average of 10 in the US vs 35 in the U.K.), and healthcare (hello, NHS!)\n",
      "I think generally in the U.K. we have better and more widely available public transport so living outside the city without a car is also more viable. I can’t speak to how much a two bedroom costs in Central London because, well, no one aside from literal millionaires lives there, but my four bedroom house in the suburbs, 45 minute commute to work, was bought for £425,000.\n",
      "You're in 97 percentile and have to commute 45 minutes to work? Don't you see anything wrong with that?\n",
      "45min isn’t that bad for commute, I am confused with @Pepegaquen comment as well\n",
      "The fact that you can't see anything wrong with that says more about London and the salaries there than the commute.\n",
      "Sorry pal but you just sound ignorant and condescending. there is more that counts toward standard of living and there are plenty of things in the UK (or Europe in general) that are “free” and contributes to higher standard if living compared to the US. Stuff like free healthcare, up to 1 year maternity leave (6-9 months paid), 30 days annual holiday, pluss bunch of other perks are alien to most Americans\n",
      "No, it says more about you.\n",
      "45 minutes is fairly standard, no?\n",
      "Nothing is worth that lack of social security imo.\n",
      "Exactly. Pay in the Netherlands is also far less. The only way to get that amount is by starting your own business. There is a general rule of thumb that if you get paid 35k year after taxes, that will be around 50k a year before taxes. However, total costs for the employer actually would be around 90k to 100k (all in euro's). To prevent all these extra costs, you start your own (single-person) business 🤷‍♀️\n",
      "Never met you and having only read this I can say I like you\n",
      "Dude, chill, that's a shitty salary and I'm sure you'll be able to see it with a simple research on Glassdoor. No need to be angry ,\n",
      "I'm not angry. The bloke I responded to is being incredibly immature around working location and salary, and judging by your response so are you.\n",
      "Salaries across regions in a given country aren't comparable - you must know this. The cost of living across areas is different, as is the demand for your role. So imagine how different they are cross country - when you also take into account the culture around working hours, tax, yearly paid holidays, medical care, transport and housing costs.\n",
      "You asked me to do a search on Glassdoor. \n",
      "What would be your suggestion here? Should I leave a comfortable lifestyle here, for a less comfortable lifestyle in the US thousands of miles away from my family and friends?\n",
      "aight, I might have underestimated how shitty London is. Anyway remote work is always an option\n",
      "Fuck me - you would think that this being a career-focused subreddit would filter out some of the juveniles but I guess not?\n",
      "Are you basing London being “shitty” on salary alone? Did you not want to include free healthcare, amazing public transport, proximity to Europe, better work-life balance and 3x as many paid holidays in that assessment…?\n",
      "BRB - let me tell the thousands of tech workers who choose to live and work here over the US that it’s shitty and that they’re stupid.\n",
      "Please grow up. This doesn’t look good on you.\n",
      "Lool, you seem to take really seriously the offense on London. Let me tell me one thing. I'm from Italy, I also have healthcare and stuff. But salary is shitty anyway. The salaries compared to US are still shitty, even if we consider healthcare and stuff. There are tech workers also here, but I have no idea why they're doing this, I would consider a remote job ASAP. Let me tell you another thing, as a data engineer you have tou put ego aside and let the data speak. The data says that even w/ the right proportions, UK salaries are not as good as US ones. This is ok, it's just that the tech scene in EU is not as developed as the one in the US, but we have to work on this by asking more. You as a tech worker shouldn't say things like \"I'm in the best 97%\" bc u r doing the most requested job at the moment, so you should be at 99.9% top. You should ask for higher salaries, if all the people were like you we would have lower and lower salaries.\n",
      "And please grow down. With grow down I mean: have more fun on Reddit, and be more competitive (kids are competitive) and always asking for more, because the benefit that you and, in the future, me, bring to the companies are invaluable.\n",
      "Why did you take my comment so personally? I think you're a bit too sensitive to have been offended by that, and somehow not surprised you knew the percentile off the top of your head.\n",
      "With your experience and the company you're at, you would be paid at least triple in the US and that's AFTER all COL adjustments that people like to use to dismiss the differences. Maybe the US isn't for you, I didn't say it was, because my comment on salaries was meant to be taken generally.\n",
      "And, personally for me, I think maturity would be realising that working for 3 years to match someone working 1 year of working in the states is a waste of the most precious commodity on Earth.\n",
      "I have been to the US multiple times and I can tell you that I would hate to live there. As people have mentioned salary isn’t everything, you need to account other things like cost of living, standard of living etc.\n",
      "No doubt US has higher salaries for Data Engineering jobs (or other SWE jobs) compared to Europe. But you need to account for working hours, annual leave, maternity leave (US is terrible with this), education system if you are about to start family, healthcare.\n",
      "There are many areas where in my opinion the US is lacking behind and why I chose to live in UK rather than the US (I am not from the UK)\n",
      "I’m not taking it personally, I’m reacting to your immaturity. If you know the US isn’t for everyone, why did you feel the need to comment?\n",
      "You talk about not working in the states being a waste of the most precious commodity on Earth. You know what’s also a precious commodity? Living near to my friends and family. Being able to put roots down because I’m a UK citizen and I can stay where I am for the long term. Having decent public transport. Socialised healthcare and not needing to worry about expensive medical bills. 35 days paid leave a year rather than 10. Shorter average working weeks. The ability to hop to hundreds of European destinations within three hours or less.\n",
      "If the US really was that great, no one would want to work for FAANG in the U.K., but guess what? For my company, London is the biggest engineering hub outside of the US, and we have staff from around 100 different countries…\n",
      "you are getting fucked\n",
      "Care to elabore?\n",
      "Why is my 97th percentile salary for the UK me \"getting fucked\"?\n",
      "These people are chatting shit. I'm in the UK senior range and hire people. UK London base Salaries in DE and Software as an Individual Contributor generally Top out in the 80-100K Range unless you're some sort of deep domain expert, doing something very unusual/technical or it's actually a borderline management job. The only recruiters pitching significantly beyond 100K regularly for Individual Contributor roles are a smattering of Fin-tech/Banking jobs and if they're offering that much they will always shout about it.\n",
      "I earned less at FAANG albeit with a little less experience.\n",
      "was your education background or experience more of a factor in your good salary? what stack?\n",

      "In Analytics my titles have been Fraud Analyst, Business Analytics Specialist, and Business Intelligence and Data Analytics Analyst. All but the Fraud Analyst job have really just been a Data Analyst role with heavy doses of data querying/reporting.\n",
      "For in depth specifics on each role though they’re all a smidge different but the same. Fraud Analyst was my first job out of college and the odd man out. It was more about using a company tool to review e-commerce orders for signs of fraud(i.e. order contains high risk items, shipping info doesn’t make sense with ip/billing info, etc.)\n",
      "As a Business Analytics Specialist it was about using transaction data to create Fraud rules. Since we were responsible for getting our own Data it was extremely SQL intensive(specifically HiveQL since the data was stored in Hadoop Hive Tables). I used Oozie to automate  data loading and transformations then had it fed to a Tableau dashboard for KPIs on Fraud and rule performance. For analysis or data manipulation I used R and for ad-hoc analysis or query also used R to pull data in for manipulation(DBpyler allowed me to connect to Hive and bring data in).\n",
      "As a Business Intelligence and Analytics Analyst I used mostly sql with some R for manipulation. My main project there was the modernization of an old Adanas Mainframe system to modern SQL database(Oracle specifically). So it was a-lot of data modeling, querying, analysis using PLSQL and Oracle Data Modeling from SqlDeveloper.\n",
      "At my current role it’s much more of a Software Engineer who specializes in Data. Since we work in the cloud I use a lot of AWS services(team is an AWS shop but company as a whole utilized bother Azure and AWS). For this role I’m using Python for general scripting, MySQL for data querying(utilizing RDS MySQL instances), github for version control/deployments to test/production environments(and migrating to GitHub Actions from Travis CI for Lambda Deployments and configuration). Since I’m still new that will likely increase but that’s just my current usage(I.e. will be expanding into using NoSQL and Java for a DynamoDB use-case).\n",
      "Pretty much all roles besides Fraud Analyst require a number of soft skills(communication, time/project management, stakeholder engagement, being coachable etc.). And really the stacks doesn’t matter as much as the mindset, mainly the ability to learn and improve . If your willing to put the work in and give a solid effort a lot of people will overlook not knowing certain tools or technology. For example I technically failed my skills test(was a Hackerrank exam but I didn’t interpret the question correctly) however got hired because I was able to talk through my thought process to arrive at an answer.\n",
      "Thank you for your very thorough answer! Your Fraud Analyst job sounded really cool.\n",
      "What kind of scripts do you write?\n",
      "No prob, sorry for the typos(speed typing on my phone in between meetings). I was hired to replace a system that generates leads from payment files so most/all of my python scripts are dedicated to data manipulation or analysis in one form or another. For instance I’m currently refining an algorithm that uses fuzzy matching logic on company names for entity resolution by accessing and parsing files from s3 and spitting the output it back into s3(this will be moving to be tables very soon).\n",

      "It really depends on the product and its reach. Equity can be life changing but keep in mind that it is only for a really small fraction of startups. You need to do your own assessment of the companyn to estimate of they're worth it or not. It's a gamble.\n",

      "Thank you, it is a dream of most people in tech here!\n",
      "On the topic of salary, it is the reality here in Brazil. The minimum wage here is around R$1.100/month, and some families live with less than that due to poor labor conditions and obsolete salaries, especially with the rising inflation as Covid ravaged through the economy.\n",
      "On the other hand, it is pretty common here to stay with your parents well into your mid 20s, so I basically live for free at home and I save/invest like 80% of my salary. Most brazilians have to work early to help their families stay afloat, but I'm very privileged not to have to, and can use my money for myself.\n",
      "R$1.500/mo is actually one of the best internship salaries out there, only interns in large banks get more than that (usually around R$2k/mo ($390 USD/mo)). Junior level salaries for DEs are in the R$5k range ($1000 USD/mo). A fellow DE posted on the last salary discussion he made R$9.5k/mo (close to $2k USD/mo) with several years of experience.\n",
      "The reality is just that the cost of living here is much much cheaper than in the US. A decent apartment rental for couple who is starting their lives together in my hometown (which is really expensive) is around R$2k/mo ($390 USD), which people abroad would die for since it sounds really cheap for you guys, but is actually two whole minimum wages for us. If you make compromises you can live for pretty cheap, just not on great neighborhoods. Most places are pretty ugly to be fair. I see people in the US hating the \"cul de sac\" suburb style, but as a brazilian I absolutely love seeing houses with grass, trees and no walls on their property.\n",

I, however, also recognize that having the chance to work abroad is a massive massive privilege. Most people here will never have the same opportunity.\n",
      "But then, I want to have a confortable life, as we all do, and I'll do whatever I can to make that dream come true.\n",

I wanted to add another language to my tool belt and chose scala as it helps to teach you a bit about functional programming and the jvm seems to be the backbone of many big data processing frameworks (spark, presto, flink, etc). I still mostly use python but think learning scala has made me a better python developer and developer in general.\n",

      "I agree with the other poster that learning to use a functional language like Scala can help improve one's programming: learning Scheme and Standard ML in university really improved my programming.

At some point this just feels like execuses.   Eventually I replied to some recruiter reachouts and they were giving me senior and 180-200k, so I went back to my manager and did the talk again.  I didn’t actually bring up the offers but I think that gave me enough confidence that he could read me and gave me the promotion. I guess even if you feel like you don’t want to blackmail your company with an outside offer, it still helps a lot by giving you the confidence and alternative option.\n",
