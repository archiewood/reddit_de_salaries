2021-06-01,"Hey, sounds like you've got some pretty relevant experience! Knowing SQL really well is a huge part of the job, so you'v got a big leg up for sure!","On my side, I moved over to Data Engineering from more of a Full-stack Web Developer background (Front-end/Back-end Software Engineering). The skills transferred over pretty well, so I think you will not have much trouble with your background either. I would just recommend:",- Brush up on Python (it's pretty prevalent these days and thankfully is pretty easy to pickup),"Beyond that I would say try to do some small sample projects and put them on your Github. From there, interview around at some firms! My company lets candidates choose a programming language of their choice during interviews, and the interview itself was mostly problem solving (and very conversational, not an interrogation), not even much about Data Engineering itself. It's a relatively new field and there are tons of positions opening up in Toronto (and Canada) now. The future is looking bright in DE, really hope you can join us here soon too. Good luck!",,,
2021-06-01,Thanks for the advice!,I have a few more questions if you don‚Äôt mind:,Thanks!,,,,
2021-06-01,"A certificate is nice, but honestly I think the best way to learn it is to just play around with it in some kind of exercise/personal project.. AWS for instance offers a really generous free tier system that lets you experiment with most services before you commit. Services like Redshift, DynamoDB, Lambda, and Kinesis are all super useful to pick up. I've done this course in the past (to learn some services) and it was a really gentle introduction if that's your thing:","It really depends. Some companies do emphasize L33T Code unfortunately, but some don't. A lot of companies (in Canada at least) are moving towards more discussion-based interviews, where they present a problem and you work through it together. It is more about testing your skills/competencies related to programming/problem solving and less so on memorizing algorithms. For this it unfortunately comes down to practice imo, so picking up some books can help get you started with the right mindset. I highly recommend Cracking the Coding Interview (","Honestly anything works here. Just Google ""Data Engineering Projects"" and go with it. Spin up a streaming service (for something). Spin up an orchestrated data pipeline using Airflow. Deploy a small application that scrapes data from a public database, massages/transforms it and stores it in a Data Warehouse. It really is not that important what you pick as long as it's relevant to Data Engineering, or Software Engineering in general.",,,,
2021-06-01,"Hi, you've given good insights on the interview process. A big thanks.....",Need your view/opinion on DE industry in Canada. How big is it? What could be the average pay according to you? (I understand cost of living is different across Canada),"Also I'm planning to do masters in US, CA so that I can work there for few years. Which country would you prefer??  Personally I'm intrigued with the culture, society of Canada(people, healthcare, govt).","If I have to choose some university from Canada, what would you suggest??","Thanks in advance, have asked too many questions üò•. Currently in a mid life crisis.",,
2021-06-01,Hi no problem.,"The DE industry in Canada is growing all the time. Virtually all companies these days rely on Big Data to some extent, and most are applying Data Science/ML to solve problems too. In order for both to scale, you need Data Engineers to move and clean up the data! This article about Canada's tech scene gives a good overview of the industry nowadays: ","As far as pay, it really depends. I don't have visibility into company pay structures directly, but this is a great resource for getting some insight into the market in general:","With the onset of remote working being a necessity (and likely sticking around for a while after the pandemic is over) too, it also makes salary harder to track. You would need to do your research on the company-level at that ","I cannot comment on working in the United States as I have never lived nor worked there. I was born, raised, and have lived in Canada my entire life. I am biased in saying Canada has many advantages (free healthcare, lower crime rates in large cities, less gun violence proportionally, a smaller population density, better educational levels), but the United States is an amazing country as well. I always enjoy visiting there, but I do not know if I would want to live there. Their salary, amentities, and weather are all superior to Canada, among other things, but they also have a much more individual mindset and I always find they are a country of winners and losers (some with a lot many with none). Take that as you will. ","If you do decide to study in Canada, we have a bunch of great universities as well. Macleans does an awesome job of ranking universities by program, which you can ",Always happy to help. I hope it all works out and you will be joining the ranks of Data Engineering soon as well!
2021-06-01,Thanks a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Detailed explanation with references.,"QQ:- I'm looking for universities so that I can work in Canada, not interested into research much. Actually was asking you if there are specific programs or univs which have tailored content in data engineering/big data. Heard some of them have coop too which makes it easier to enter the industry.",Thanks again ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,,,,

2021-06-01,"Sure but it was nowhere close to my salary increase, even though I went from LCOL to VHCOL. On top of that a bunch of expenses went down: my wife and I were able to get rid of one car so our insurance dropped, and because we went from a no-fault state to a tort state, our premium went down from what a one car premium would be in Florida. Food can be as cheap or expensive as you make it, utilities are cheaper because you don‚Äôt need to run A/C all the time and if you‚Äôre renting most buildings pay for heat. My utility bill could be as low as 30 or 40 dollars outside of summer in Boston.","Less tangibly, but arguably more important, there is a lot more opportunity for software engineers in a city like Boston, whereas where I was there was only a handful of employers, most offering below market for the state. A year after doubling my base, my employer was winding down (thanks CFIUS!) so I went to another company and increased my base another 30%.","Also the work and benefits are miles better here, I‚Äôve had equity at every employer I‚Äôve worked at (one just got acquired so that‚Äôll be a nice bonus), flexible work at home, bonuses, great insurance, and working on interesting hard problems. None of that was a thing in my previous small market, I‚Äôve had managers give me a hard time for coming in at 9:05 after learning my grandfather was dying.",Best move of my career.,,,
2021-06-01,It's a very interesting discussion.,Most HR departments nation wide use salary bands to control wages for employees.,"ie most positions are hired as ""we are advertising this role inside our salary band X, we will pay more or less at HR's discretion but it has to be within this salary band we bought from a specialist firm.""",Even for Google etc this is true.  And these bands are national.,"It's only when the local labour markets ""break"" these salary bands that salaries get big.","Ie companies are hiring for a position, the local labour market just won't produce any candidates under national paybands with a regional percentage adjustment, and they won't compromise on the quality of candidate.","Then HR has to fly by night to get things done, and that's when you see people getting very outsized salary offers."

2021-12-01,"In Analytics my titles have been Fraud Analyst, Business Analytics Specialist, and Business Intelligence and Data Analytics Analyst. All but the Fraud Analyst job have really just been a Data Analyst role with heavy doses of data querying/reporting.","For in depth specifics on each role though they‚Äôre all a smidge different but the same. Fraud Analyst was my first job out of college and the odd man out. It was more about using a company tool to review e-commerce orders for signs of fraud(i.e. order contains high risk items, shipping info doesn‚Äôt make sense with ip/billing info, etc.)",As a Business Analytics Specialist it was about using transaction data to create Fraud rules. Since we were responsible for getting our own Data it was extremely SQL intensive(specifically HiveQL since the data was stored in Hadoop Hive Tables). I used Oozie to automate  data loading and transformations then had it fed to a Tableau dashboard for KPIs on Fraud and rule performance. For analysis or data manipulation I used R and for ad-hoc analysis or query also used R to pull data in for manipulation(DBpyler allowed me to connect to Hive and bring data in).,"As a Business Intelligence and Analytics Analyst I used mostly sql with some R for manipulation. My main project there was the modernization of an old Adanas Mainframe system to modern SQL database(Oracle specifically). So it was a-lot of data modeling, querying, analysis using PLSQL and Oracle Data Modeling from SqlDeveloper.","At my current role it‚Äôs much more of a Software Engineer who specializes in Data. Since we work in the cloud I use a lot of AWS services(team is an AWS shop but company as a whole utilized bother Azure and AWS). For this role I‚Äôm using Python for general scripting, MySQL for data querying(utilizing RDS MySQL instances), github for version control/deployments to test/production environments(and migrating to GitHub Actions from Travis CI for Lambda Deployments and configuration). Since I‚Äôm still new that will likely increase but that‚Äôs just my current usage(I.e. will be expanding into using NoSQL and Java for a DynamoDB use-case).","Pretty much all roles besides Fraud Analyst require a number of soft skills(communication, time/project management, stakeholder engagement, being coachable etc.). And really the stacks doesn‚Äôt matter as much as the mindset, mainly the ability to learn and improve . If your willing to put the work in and give a solid effort a lot of people will overlook not knowing certain tools or technology. For example I technically failed my skills test(was a Hackerrank exam but I didn‚Äôt interpret the question correctly) however got hired because I was able to talk through my thought process to arrive at an answer.",

2022-03-01,Thank you!,"I was lucky to join a startup years ago, I stuck around and it paid off!",Job hopping is not always the solution!,,,,
2022-03-01,"I was offered a batch of stock options when I signed my first contract and another 3x larger batch 3 years in. My salary increased almost each year, never by less than 15%. After the acquisition, I got a huge bump (+55%) and stock options in the acquiring company.",It really depends on the product and its reach. Equity can be life changing but keep in mind that it is only for a really small fraction of startups. You need to do your own assessment of the companyn to estimate of they're worth it or not. It's a gamble.,"Also, equity should be considered a bonus and not salary. If you're underpaid, I would ask for a raise or move.","I'm really lucky, my salary was good, the product was good, so I stayed and it paid off.

2022-03-01,"Thank you, it is a dream of most people in tech here!","On the topic of salary, it is the reality here in Brazil. The minimum wage here is around R$1.100/month, and some families live with less than that due to poor labor conditions and obsolete salaries, especially with the rising inflation as Covid ravaged through the economy.","On the other hand, it is pretty common here to stay with your parents well into your mid 20s, so I basically live for free at home and I save/invest like 80% of my salary. Most brazilians have to work early to help their families stay afloat, but I'm very privileged not to have to, and can use my money for myself.","R$1.500/mo is actually one of the best internship salaries out there, only interns in large banks get more than that (usually around R$2k/mo ($390 USD/mo)). Junior level salaries for DEs are in the R$5k range ($1000 USD/mo). A fellow DE posted on the last salary discussion he made R$9.5k/mo (close to $2k USD/mo) with several years of experience.","The reality is just that the cost of living here is much much cheaper than in the US. A decent apartment rental for couple who is starting their lives together in my hometown (which is really expensive) is around R$2k/mo ($390 USD), which people abroad would die for since it sounds really cheap for you guys, but is actually two whole minimum wages for us. If you make compromises you can live for pretty cheap, just not on great neighborhoods. Most places are pretty ugly to be fair. I see people in the US hating the ""cul de sac"" suburb style, but as a brazilian I absolutely love seeing houses with grass, trees and no walls on their property.",,
